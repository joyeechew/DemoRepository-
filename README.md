This is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a "syntax" that allows us to write simple text that can be transformed into HTML.(*HTML is a **mark-up** Language.*)

We can make text that is **bold** or *italic* by wrapping the words or phrases in either double or single asterixes. 

We can also create lists, like the following un-ordered list. 

- First Item
- Second Item
- Last Item
